# Happy Reading with Google Books


### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA/REQUIREMENTS:
* Application should: 
    * Allow user to search for books, save the ones they like, and links for purchase options using the Google Book Api (https://developers.google.com/books)
    * The search results should return:
        - `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API
        - `authors` - The book's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API
        - `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API
        - `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API
        - `link` - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API

### DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
* Create repo and install required packages
* Create react app using 'npx create-react-app client'
* 
* Create component files, update App.js and Index.js
* Create a MongoDB Atlas collection and connect to database
* Create app folders
* Create seed/db, service worker, routes, models, controller files
* 
* Check functionality
* Create db in Mongo and link to Heroku
* Deploy app

### COMMITS:
