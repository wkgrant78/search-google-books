# Search for Your Next Book


### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA/REQUIREMENTS:
* Application should: 
    * Allow user to search for books and save the ones they like using the Google book api (https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=)
    * The search results should return:
        - `title - Title of the book from the Google Books API
        - `authors - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API
        - `description - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API
        - `image - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API
        - `link - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API
